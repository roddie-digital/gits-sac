## Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Context

Take screenshots from Ghost in Shell series and films and post them to Mastodon every two hours. Toots with no interaction auto-delete after three months. Blu-rays are ripped with MakeMKV, screenshots are taken with ffmpeg (via a Powershell script snapping every 30 seconds) and Pipedream runs a Python script using the mastodon.py module to post the toot on the [botsin.space](https://botsin.space) instance.
