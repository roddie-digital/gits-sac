Take screenshots from Ghost in Shell series and films and post them to Mastodon every two hours. Toots with no interaction auto-delete after two weeks. Blu-rays are ripped with MakeMKV, screenshots are taken with ffmpeg (via a Powershell script snapping every ùë• seconds) and Pipedream runs a Python script using the mastodon.py module to post the toot on the [roddie.social](https://roddie.social/@ghostintheshell) instance. The account is also now bridged to Bluesky via [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) with the user [@ghostintheshell.roddie.social](https://bsky.app/profile/ghostintheshell.roddie.social). Posts are tagged with specific hashtags in case followers want to mute Arise or maybe everything except the 1995 film, for example.

The project was inspired by [Stefan Bohacek](https://stefanbohacek.online/@stefan) and his guide [Making a Mastodon bot that posts random images](https://botwiki.org/resource/tutorial/making-a-mastodon-bot-that-posts-random-images/). I modified his script to use image files stored in Github rather than Google Drive, removed the alt tag field and added a sensitivity field. The bot was originally made possible by [Colin Mitchell](https://muffin.industries/@colin)'s Mastodon server [botsin.space](https://botsin.space).
